Procedures
1. tranform_to_platform_df.sh creates dataformat that will be used by the annotation platform ---> changes raw predictions to the annotationplatform datatype with ["metadata"] and ["content"]

2. Run run_prediction_mixer.sh to mix predictions from different models--> creates refined and unrefined folders which contain a clean list of distractors with no distractor duplicates (refined),
and crude merging of distractors in the unrefined folder with additional duplicates mapping file

3. Jobs_creator.py ---> creates jobs_pool that will be used by the platform.


DONOT forget to run run_transform_to_new_qids.sh. It changes the ids to consecutive 0,1,2,3... based on a mapping dictionary. The annotation platform expects ids of questions in that format.
