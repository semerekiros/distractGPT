The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse ( Aesop ) Now you must know that a town mouse once upon a time went on a visit to his cousin in the country . He was rough and ready , this cousin , but he loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome . Beans and bacon , cheese and bread , were all he had to offer , but he offered them freely . The town mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country fare , and said : ' I can not understand , cousin , how you can put up with such poor food as this , but of course you can not expect anything better in the country ; come you with me and I will show you how to live . When you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have stood a country life . ' No sooner said than done : the two mice set off for the town and arrived at the town mouse 's residence late at night . 'You will want some refreshment after our long journey , ' said the polite town mouse , and took his friend into the grand dining-room . There they found the remains of a fine feast , and soon the two mice were eating up jellies and cakes and all that was nice . Suddenly they heard growling and barking . 'What is that ? ' said the country mouse . 'It is only the dogs of the house , ' answered the other . 'Only ! ' said the country mouse . ' I do not like that music at my dinner ! ' Just at that moment the door flew open , in came two huge mastiffs ; and the two mice had to scamper down and run off . 'Good-bye , cousin , ' said the country mouse . 'What ! Going so soon ? ' said the other . 'Yes , ' he replied . 'Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear . What does the word 'refreshment ' mean ?",
