BAN ON 75W BULBS Starting today , it is illegal to manufacture or import 75W incandescent light bulbs in the European Union . The phaseout started last year when 100W light bulbs were outlawed . Bulbs of 60W will be phased out next year , and incandescent lighting of all types will be phased out in 2012 . The phase-out of incandescent light bulbs is part of the EU 's strategy to cut greenhouse gases by 20 % by 2020 . Replacing the old lamps with more efficient models is expected to reduce energy consumption for lighting by 60 % in the EU , equivalent to saving 30 million tons of CO2 pollution every year . Although energy-saving bulbs were available since 1998 , their relatively high purchase price has inhibited take-up . When the decision for the ban was taken in 2008 , it was estimated that around 2,000 to 3,000 jobs would become redundant in the light bulb industry .
